This website is a simple one page design. It displays a picture of me at the top followed by multiple sections including About Me, Skills, Education, Work History and Projects.

This project is open source to allow others to use this design for their own website.

Built to be responsive for mobile devices and displays a different picture that better fits smaller screen sizes.
